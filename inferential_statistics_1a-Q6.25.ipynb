    "Here we have calculated the actual standard deviation of a small (size 5) data set. But in this case, this small data set is actually a sample from our larger (infinite) population. In this case, the population is infinite because we could keep drawing our normal random variates until our computers die. In general, the sample mean we calculate will not be equal to the population mean (as we saw above). A consequence of this is that the sum of squares of the deviations from the _population_ mean will be bigger than the sum of squares of the deviations from the _sample_ mean. In other words, the sum of squares of the deviations from the _sample_ mean is too small to give an unbiased estimate of the _population_ variance. An example of this effect is given [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel%27s_correction#Source_of_bias). Scaling our estimate of the variance by the factor $n/(n-1)$ gives an unbiased estimator of the population variance. This factor is known as [Bessel's correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel%27s_correction). The consequence of this is that the $n$ in the denominator is replaced by $n-1$.\n",

As our samples will be expected to vary from one draw to another, so will our sample statistics. If we were to perform repeat draws of size $n$ and calculate the mean of each, we would expect to obtain a distribution of values. This is the sampling distribution of the mean. The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) tells us that such a distribution will approach a normal distribution as $n$ increases.

From this sample, we want to make inferences about the population. We may do this, for example, by looking at the histogram of the values and by calculating the mean and standard deviation (as estimates of the population parameters), and so we are intrinsically interested in how these quantities vary across samples. In other words, now that we've taken one sample of size $n$ and made some claims about the general population, what if we were to take another sample of size $n$? Would we get the same result? Would we make the same claims about the general population?

    "Remember, we rarely (if ever) actually know our population parameters but you still have to estimate them somehow. If we want to make inferences such as \"is this observation unusual?\" or \"has my population mean changed?\" then you need to have some idea of what the underlying distribution is so you can calculate relevant probabilities. In frequentist inference, you use the formulas above to deduce these population parameters. Take a moment in the next part of this assignment to refresh your understanding of how these probabilities work."

    "Recall some basic properties of the standard Normal distribution, such as about 68% of observations being within plus or minus 1 standard deviation of the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Q:__ Using this fact, calculate the probability of observing the value 1 or less in a single observation from the standard normal distribution. Hint: you may find it helpful to sketch the standard normal distribution (the familiar bell shape) and mark the number of standard deviations from the mean on the x-axis and shade the regions of the curve that contain certain percentages of the population."

We've said a couple of times that we rarely, if ever, know the true population parameters; we have to estimate them from our sample and we cannot even begin to estimate the standard deviation from a single observation. This is very true and usually we have sample sizes larger than one. This means we can calculate the mean of the sample as our best estimate of the population mean and the standard deviation as our best estimate of the population standard deviation. In other words, we are now coming to deal with the sampling distributions we mentioned above as we are generally concerned with the properties of the sample means we obtain.\n",

This is the key driver for us 'requiring' a certain sample size, for example you may frequently see a minimum sample size of 30 stated in many places. In reality this is simply a rule of thumb; if the underlying distribution is approximately normal then your sampling distribution will already be pretty normal, but if the underlying distribution is heavily skewed then you'd want to increase your sample size."

    "# How to Calculate Margin of Error: Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Find the critical value. The critical value is either a t-score or a z-score. If you aren’t sure, see: T-score vs z-score. In general, for small sample sizes (under 30) or when you don’t know the population standard deviation, use a t-score. Otherwise, use a z-score.\n",
    "Click here for a minute video that shows you how to find a critical value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic z score formula for a sample is:\n",
    "z = (x – μ) / σ\n",
    "For example, let’s say you have a test score of 190. The test has a mean (μ) of 150 and a standard deviation (σ) of 25. Assuming a normal distribution, your z score would be: \n",
    "z = (x – μ) / σ \n",
    "= 190 – 150 / 25 = 1.6.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Find the Standard Deviation or the Standard Error. These are essentially the same thing, only you must know your population parameters in order to calculate standard deviation. Otherwise, calculate the standard error (see: What is the Standard Error?).\n",
    "Click here for a short video on how to calculate the standard error.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Multiply the critical value from Step 1 by the standard deviation or standard error from Step 2. For example, if your CV is 1.95 and your SE is 0.019, then:\n",
    "1.95 * 0.019 = 0.03705\n",
    "Example question: 900 students were surveyed and had an average GPA of 2.7 with a standard deviation of 0.4. Calculate the margin of error for a 90% confidence level:\n",
    "The critical value is 1.645 (see this video for the calculation)\n",
    "The standard deviation is 0.4 (from the question), but as this is a sample, we need the standard error for the mean. The formula for the SE of the mean is standard deviation / √(sample size), so: 0.4 / √(900) = 0.013.\n",
    "1.645 * 0.013 = 0.021385\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example question: Find a critical value for a 90% confidence level (Two-Tailed Test). \n",
    "### Step 1: Subtract the confidence level from 100% to find the α level: 100% – 90% = 10%.\n",
    "### Step 2: Convert Step 1 to a decimal: 10% = 0.10.\n",
    "### Step 3: Divide Step 2 by 2 (this is called “α/2”).\n",
